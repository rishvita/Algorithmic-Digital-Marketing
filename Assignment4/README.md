# Recommendation System
The files consists of a recommendation system for Snackfair, a custom snack shipping company that only has an online presence.

A recommender system predicts the rating value of a user-item combination with an assumption that the training data available indicates a user's preference for other items. The user-item Interaction Data, such as ratings and apply FASTAI modelling technique that uses collaborative filtering to predict user's preference.

# Collaborative Filtering :
Collaborative Filtering Methods use the collaborative power of the ratings provided by multiple users to make recommendations and rely mostly on leveraging either inter-item correlations or inter-user interactions for the prediction process

# FastAI Algorithm:
FastAI is a modern deep learning open source library. It offers ready-to-use functions to train models in various applications, offering customizable models with sensible defaults. FastAI is built on Keras for higher speed and pytorch for higher customizability FastAI provides a single DataLoaders class which automatically constructs validation and training data loaders. The mid-level API provides the core deep learning and data-processing methods for each of these applications, and low-level APIs provide a library of optimized primitives and functional and object-oriented foundations, which allows the mid-level to be developed and customised
