## Part2
### Attribution Modeling
Attribution modeling is a framework for analyzing which touchpoints, or marketing channels, receive credit for a conversion. Each attribution model distributes the value of a conversion across each touchpoint differently. A model comparison tool allows you to analyze how each model distributes the value of a conversion. There are six common attribution models: First Interaction, Last Interaction, Last Non-Direct Click, Linear, Time-Decay, and Position-Based.

By analyzing each attribution model, one can get a better idea of the ROI for each marketing channel/campaign.

Types of Marketing Models we will be implementing-

### Single-Touch Attribution Models
Single-touch attribution models assign 100% of conversion credit to one marketing touchpoint. Even if a customer saw 20 ads before converting, single-touch attribution will determine that only 1 of the 20 ads deserves conversion credit.
Single-touch attribution models are easy to implement because of their low level of complexity. Theyâ€™re also the most popular attribution models because of their historical tie to Google Ads
The models are
1. First Touch Attribution (FTA)
2. Last Touch Attribution (LTA)

### Multi-Touch Attribution Models:
Multi-touch attribution is best described in contrast to its counterpart, single-touch attribution.
In order to divide the revenue credit for a sale properly, multi-touch attribution uses weighted modeling in order to allocate credit to the plethora of influential channels, campaigns, keywords, and touchpoints.
Weighted touchpoint modeling assigns a percentage of the revenue credit for a customer to an array of touchpoints, as defined by the respective multi-touch attribution model chosen by the organization.
The models are:
1. Logistic Regression Model
2. Time-decay Attribution Model
3. Linear Attribution Model
4. U-Shaped Attribution Model



## Data

We have to use the Criteo Attribution Bidding Dataset and build Attribution models to optimize the Budget Allocation for various Marketing campaigns.

This dataset represents a sample of 30 days of Criteo live traffic data. Each line corresponds to one impression (a banner) that was displayed to a user. For each banner we have detailed information about the context, if it was clicked, if it led to a conversion and if it led to a conversion that was attributed to Criteo or not.
